Polylog
=======

The Polylog package provides Rust implementation of real and complex
polylogarithms.

The Polylog package depends on the `num` crate.


Notes
-----

The implementation of the real dilogarithm has been taken from the
[ROOT](root.cern.ch) package, licensed under the GNU LGPL.

The implementation of the complex dilogarithm has been taken from
[SPheno](spheno.hepforge.org) and has been translated to Rust.
